# PRODIGY_ST_05
Automated UI checkout test using Selenium WebDriver in Python for an e-commerce website. Covers login, adding items to cart, checkout form validation, and order confirmation as part of Task-05 of the Prodigy Infotech Software Testing Internship.
As part of my Prodigy Infotech Software Testing Internship (Task-05), I developed an automated UI test for the complete checkout flow on an e-commerce demo site using Selenium and Python.

The automation simulates a real user experience: logging in, adding products to the cart, filling in shipping details, and completing the purchase. Each step is validated to ensure smooth transitions and form handling. The script confirms a successful transaction by verifying the final "Thank You" message.

Through this task, I gained practical experience in:

UI flow testing

Cross-page validation

Web element interaction

Form submission testing
